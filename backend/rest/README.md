## 1. Introduction to REST

---

In this guide we are going to describe the best practices we consider most relevant at design time for a good REST API.

According to Wikipedia's definition:

* *Representational state transfer (REST)* ***is a software architectural style*** *that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful Web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. Other kinds of Web services, such as SOAP Web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of operations. * [[1](#rest_wikipedia)] 

This definition implies that REST is an architectural style rather than an implementation. When we want to refer to an implementation of this architecture, we refer to ***RESTFul***.

Use of REST APIs is often preferred over SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) style, not only because SOAP is heavier but also because REST does not leverage as much bandwidth, which makes it a better fit for use over the Internet.

REST, which typically runs over HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), has several architectural constraints:

1. Uniform interface  

2. Client-server

3. Stateless

4. Cacheable

5. Layered system

6. Code on demand

REST style emphasizes that interactions between clients and services are enhanced by having a limited number of operations (verbs) to perform. Flexibility is provided by assigning resources (nouns) their own unique Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs). As each verb has a specific meaning (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, ...), REST avoids ambiguity.

Use of hypermedia, both for application information and for application's state transitions: state representation in a REST system is typically HTML, XML or JSON. As a result, it is possible to navigate from a REST resource to other by simply following links without requiring the use of registries or another additional infrastructure.

## 2. URL Construction

---

The first important thing in the URL construction is not using verbs, **only nouns**. This is because the verbs are implicit in the method. The main methods are:

Method	| Verb
---		| ---	
POST    | Create
GET		| Read
PUT		| Update
DELETE	| Delete	

With this in mind, you can start thinking about appropriate nouns to describe your resources. It is recommended that chosen nouns are as **simple as posible and best describe** the resource.

Some things to remember when constructing your URLs:

- Make them short, to make them easy to write and remember.
- Make them predictable, to makes the users understand them and site structure. 
- Nouns should be plural to make more easy to use for the users (or at least keep your criteria over the whole API)
- Use the same noun with different HTTP methods to perform required actions over that resource.

### Relations

Related resources must be referenced in a hierarchical way, putting resource identifiers immediately after its noun. For example: 

```
/films/57/reviews		// Return all the reviews for film with identifier 57
/films/57/reviews/5		// Return review with identifier 5 for film with identifier 57
```


### Versioning
It is strongly recommended to use a version number for **every release** of your API. To avoid ambiguity with identifiers, we recommend to use a 'v' preceding the version number as part of URLs.

Only put the **MAJOR** version number, never the MINOR or PATCH. For example don't use v1.2 or v2.1.3.

Correct form:
```
/api/v1/films			// Return all the films of version 1
/api/v2/films/57		// Return the film 57 of version 2
```

## 3. Operations over resources

---

Operations over resources are limited but number of resources are not. REST operations are described by standard HTTP methods.

There are operations that are **idempotent**, it means that it can be called many times with the same outcome, keeping the same system state.

Additionally, there are **safe operations**, which should never change the resource. These operations could be cached without any collateral effect over the resource.

### Basic operations
In a REST implementation there are four main basic operations which can be published for a resource.

#### GET

This operation retrieves information for a given resource, or all resources in a collection (if the resource is a collection). It's a safe operation and it should not have any collateral effect.

```
GET /clients/123    // Retrieves information about client resource with identifier 123

```


#### POST

It creates a new resource, specified by operation URL. Resource details are included in request body, usually as JSON or XML, depending on the API implementation.

```
POST /products
{ "name": "car", "color": "black" }
```


#### PUT

Updates an existing resource, or creates a new one if it does not exist. Again, resource details are provided in request body. 

Although POST and PUT looks similar, usually POST is used to create a new resource and PUT to update an existing resource. 

```
PUT /products/123
{ "name": "car", "color": "black" }
```


#### DELETE

It deletes the specified resource, if exists.

```
DELETE /client/123

```


### Extra operations

These are the basic operations, they allow to implement CRUD operations, but there are some extra operations. It can be used in some special requirements.

**HEAD** operation is similar to GET, but only retrieves headers for requested information. It is useful when response's size is large too large but the full response is not needed.

You are not required to implement every operation, so there is a way of finding out which operations are actually implemented: **OPTIONS** operation allows the client to discover implemented methods for a given resource.

**PATCH** can be used to update resources partially. While PUT operation must take a full resource representation as the request entity (if only few attributes are provided, the others should be removed), PATCH operation allow partial changes to a resource. It is recommended to parameterize request body, including a field for operation to be performed, the field to be updated and the value for that field.

```
PATCH /clients/123
[
    { "op": "replace", "path": "/name", "value": "Patricia" }
]
```

It is important to maintain the purpose of each verb, as they are widely accepted by everyone. For example, POST operation must never be used to get a resource, or GET to produce any modification. All implementations in REST should be defined as a combination of resource-request_method.

## 4. Status codes

---

Unfortunately, there is not any REST standard that defines which status code should return our API for every implemented operation. In this section we are going to describe how we design our APIs in BEEVA.

### Introduction

An important aspect of REST API design is to properly define our responses' status codes, as they are the main mechanism to inform the caller about the result of his requests.

### Response structure

We recommend to use a fixed structure for all responses, adding at least a field to include response's metadata and another to include the response's data. 

For example:

``` json
{
    "result":{
        "code": 201,
        "information": "Resource created"
    },
    "data":{
        "id": "5189936c63"
    }
    
}
```

In case of errors, an 'errors' node could be used instead of 'data':

``` json
{
    "result":{
        "code": 404
    },
    "errors":[
        {
            "code": "0x0000",
            "message": "Could not find specified resource"
        }
    ]
    
}
```

### New resources

When you are creating new resources, it is a good practice to, at least return the identifier for the just created resource.

Method: POST

---

|Result 			|Code 	|Response Body 			|
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
|Successfully created	|201		|Empty					|
|Bad Request		|400		|codeError and description	|
|Invalid credentials (Unauthorized)	| 401		|codeError and description	|
|Forbidden	| 403		|codeError and description	|
|Internal Server Error	|500		|codeError and description	|

---

### Update Resources

When you are updating existing resources, it is a good practice to, at least return the identifier for the updated resource, and maybe could be useful to return the whole resource after the update.

Method: PUT

---

|Result 			|Code 	|Response Body	 					|
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
|Successfully updated	|200		|Empty or fields of updated resource		|
|Bad Request		|400		|codeError and description recommended	|
|Invalid credentials	|401		|codeError and description recommended	|
|Resource not found|404	|Empty								|

---

### Query a Resource

When you are querying an unique existing resource, the whole resource should be returned in response's body, as expected.

Method: GET.

---

|Result 				|Code 	|Response Body 						|
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
|Resource found		|200		|Full resource information |
|Resource don't exists	|204		|Empty								|
|Bad Request			|400		|codeError and description recommended	|
|Invalid credentials		|401		|codeError and description recommended	|
|Resource not found	|404		|Empty								|

---

### Query Resource List by pattern or all resources

When you are querying a list of resources by certain pattern, an object array or list should be returned as response's body.

It's also recommended to return info about pagination like total number of resources in list, number of pages, current page, etc....

Method: GET.

---

|Result 				|Code 	|Response Body 						|
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
|Resources found	|200		|Resource list with full data		|
|Resources not found	|204		|Empty								|
|Partial response|206		|Partial resource list with pagination info		|
|Bad Request			|400		|codeError and description recommended	|
|Invalid credentials		|401		|codeError and description recommended	|

---

### General Purpose

There are other status codes than have to be considered:

---

|Action										|Code 	| Example							|
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
|Request to non-existent or without sense method	| 405	| PUT over all resource collection			|
|Request to existent resource with invalid headers	| 412	| One header is no correct or missing field |
|All                                                | 429   | Too many requests (throughput restrictions, see section 10 below)

---

### Annexed 1: 2XX Success

These status codes are informative and tell the user that his request was successfully processed.

---

|Code      | Message |  Description |
| ------------- | -------------| ------------|
|200 | OK | Request completed successfully. Used mainly in response to GET methods|
| 201| Created | New resource has been created. Used in response to POST methods |
|202 | Accepted | Request has been accepted but has not been completed yet. It is a response code which is commonly used for asynchronous processing |
|204 | No Content | Request has been completed successfully but the method does not return any information. For example, when a resource exists but it does not have information or in response to a DELETE request |
|206 | Partial Content | Partial response indicates that there are more elements available to return. It is good practice to use the Content-Range header to indicate at what position we are in and how many elements is able to return the service |

---

### Annexed 2: 3XX Redirection

These response codes indicate to the user to do any additional actions to complete his request

---
|Code      | Message |  Description |
| ------------- | -------------| ------------|
| 301 | Moved Permanently | The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource should use one of the returned URIs. |
| 304 | Not Modified | In HEAD and GET requests indicates that the requested resource has not changed since the last request received. Mostly used in caching systems |

---

### Annexed 3: 4XX Client Error

These response codes are used to tell the client that there are some type of error in his request and he have to fix it before send another request

---
|Code      | Message |  Description |
| ------------- | -------------| ------------|
| 400 | Bad Request | The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. For example, request parameters in bad format in the case of a GET method or a field of a json that does not validate properly in the case of PUT/POSTS methods |
| 401 | Unauthorized | The request requires user authentication |
| 403 | Forbidden | The requested action cannot be carried out on the specified resource. For example, a DELETE operation on a resource that cannot be deleted |
| 404 |  Not Found | You cannot perform any operation on the requested resource because server has not found anything matching the Request-URI |
| 405 | Method Now Allowed | Unable to perform the specified action on the requested resource |
| 409 | Conflict | The request cannot be completed because there is a problem with the current state of the resource |
| 410 | Gone | The resource in this endpoint is no longer available. Useful for deprecate older versions of an API |
|429 | Too Many Request | Request has been denied because exceeded of rate limits |

---

### Annexed 4: 5XX Server Error

They are used to inform the user of errors in valid requests

---
|Code      | Message |  Description |
| ------------- | -------------| ------------|
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Generic code indicating an unexpected error |
| 502 | Bad Gateway | The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server|
| 504 | Gateway Timeout | The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and did not receive a timely response from the upstream server|

---

## 5. Payload formatting

---

Payload is the actual data provided in a REST message, excluding overhead data (headers and envelopes).

Both *requests* and *responses* can include a payload.

For example, in operations such as GET and DELETE, it does not make sense, because there should not be content in the payload. On the other hand, operations like PUT or POST usually contains a payload with data.
Most of the responses may contain a payload, for responses with data content and for providing extra information about the success (or not) of the operation.

There are many formats as payload, the most used are **JSON** and **XML** though. The structure for a payload depends on the information that is represented on it. It will not be the same for an item creation, error content response, successful message, etc.

Our recommendation is, at least, to support JSON format, as it is the most widely used at the moment. Nonetheless, some legacy applications could use XML still, so it could be feasible to support this format too.

**Respecting status codes** - It's a bad practice to send a response with status 200, and return in the payload the detail that the response was not successful, with a particular messages result format for our API. The payload should be used if some additional context or information is needed about the operation result.

In case our API supports several output formats, the client should be able to specify the preferred format. There are two ways to define the format of the response expected:
* Accept header: Indicating in the _Accept_ http header what are the contents types accepted. The request put _application/xml_ or _application/json_ to ask for a xml or json response format.
* Extension: other way to specify the response format is indicating the extension on the resource. For example, GET _/api/resource.xml?param=value_ or _/api/resource.json?param=value_.

As previously stated, when we are designing an API, it is very important to define a common layout for payloads on requests and responses. It will make easier for us and the clients of our REST api. It eases response understanding , be it error or success.

## 6. Filters

---

There are several ways to filter resources on a REST API. However, it is a good practice to design an API with the following features.

### Filtering

Avoid using a single parameter for filtering all fields. It is a much better approach to use one parameter for each field to filter. Use multiple comma-separated values if you need to filter a resource by multiple field values.

---
```html
GET /campaigns?status=computed&provider=CVIP,BBVA
```
---

### Sorting

Generic parameter "sort" can be used to describe sorting rules. Allow multiple fields sorting using a comma-separated field list. An interesting and compact way of specifying order direction is to use an hyphen (-) sign before fields to sort in descent order and no sign at all to sort in ascending order.

---
```html
GET /campaigns?sort=last_update,-status
```
---

### Field Selection

Sometimes API consumers do not need all resource attributes. In that cases, it is a good practice supporting the feature of selecting which fields are going to be returned. This will drastically improve our API's performance and reduce the network bandwidth usage.

---
```html
GET /campaigns?fields=id,status,name
```
---

### Searching

Use a generic query parameter like "q" to perform a full text search over your resources and return the search result in the same format as a normal list result. In order to make more complex searches allow the use of full text search operators like + - or "/ .

---
```html
GET /campaigns/search?q=PAYPAL-BBVA
```

---


## 7. Pagination

---

The right way to include pagination details today is using the ***Link header*** introduced by [RFC 5988](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#page-6)

An API that uses the Link header can return a set of ready-made links so the API consumer doesn't have to construct links themselves.

---
```html
Link: <https://www.bbvanexttechnologies.com/sample/api/v1/cars?offset=15&limit=5>; rel="next",
<https://www.bbvanexttechnologies.com/sample/api/v1/cars?offset=50&limit=3>; rel="last",
<https://www.bbvanexttechnologies.com/sample/api/v1/cars?offset=0&limit=5>; rel="first",
<https://www.bbvanexttechnologies.com/sample/api/v1/cars?offset=5&limit=5>; rel="prev"
```
---

|Name      |  Description |
| ------------- | -------------|
|next      | The link relation for the immediate next page of results.  |
|last      | The link relation for the last page of results.  |
|first      | The link relation for the first page of results.  |
|prev      | The link relation for the immediate previous page of results.  |


But this is not a complete solution as many APIs return additional pagination information, like a count of the total number of available results. An API that requires sending a count can use a custom HTTP header like ***X-Total-Count.***

On the other hand, in order to indicate the page that we want to visualize and amount of data per page, we should use some parameters in the REST call. There are some kind of pagination-based solutions, [(you cand find some of them here)](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/using-graph-api/v2.5#paging).

Anyways, no matter what pagination-based solution you choose, there must always be a parameter that indicates  the number of individual objects that are returned in each page (usually *limit*) and another one that indicates current page (like *page* , *page_number*, *offset*...)

As an alternative, you can also include pagination information as part of response's payload (HATEOAS style). For example:

---
```json
{
  "result": {
    "code": 206,
    "info": "Partial Content"
  },
  "paging": {
    "page_size": 3,
    "links": {
      "first": {
        "href": "https://www.bbvanexttechnologies.com/sample/api/v1/cars?offset=0&limit=5"
      },
      "prev": {
        "href": "https://www.bbvanexttechnologies.com/sample/api/v1/cars?offset=5&limit=5"
      },
      "next": {
        "href": "https://www.bbvanexttechnologies.com/sample/api/v1/cars?offset=15&limit=5"
      },
      "last": {
        "href": "https://www.bbvanexttechnologies.com/sample/api/v1/cars?offset=50&limit=3"
      }
    }
  },
  "data":  [
      {
        "date": "201401",
        "avg": 46.38
      },
      {
        "date": "201402",
        "avg": 45.66
      },
      {
        "date": "201403",
        "avg": 48.6
      }
    ]
}
```
---

### 8. HATEOAS
---

**Definition from Wikipedia:** "*HATEOAS, an abbreviation for Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State, is a constraint of the REST application architecture that distinguishes it from most other network application architectures. The principle is that a client interacts with a network application entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers. A REST client needs no prior knowledge about how to interact with any particular application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia. By contrast, in some service-oriented architectures (SOA), clients and servers interact through a fixed interface shared through documentation or an interface description language (IDL). The HATEOAS constraint decouples client and server in a way that allows the server functionality to evolve independently.*"

![hateoas](static/hateoas.png  "HATEOAS")

Let’s take as an example an Amazon customer who wishes to read the details of his last order. To do this, he has to follow two steps:

* List all his orders
* Select his last order

On Amazon's website, he just has to login into his account, then click on the “my orders” link and finally select the most recent one.

Now let’s imagine the customer wishes to use an API to do the same thing!

He must begin by reading Amazon's documentation to find the URL that returns the list of orders. When he finds it, he must perform a HTTP call to this URL. He’ll see the reference of his order in the list, but he’ll need to make a second call to another URL to get its details. He will have to figure out how to construct the proper URL from Amazon‘s documentation.

There is a main difference between these two scenario: In the first one, the customer just needed to know the first URL “http://www.amazon.com” then follow the links on the web page. In the second scenario, he needed to read the documentation so as to elaborate the URL.

The drawbacks of the second process are:

* The developers do not like documentation.
* In real life, the documentation can potentially be outdated. The developer may miss one or several available services just because they are not properly documented.
* The API is less accessible.

Now let’s assume we develop a component to automatically create these contextual URLs. What happens when Amazon modifies its URLs?

In practical, HATEOAS is like a urban legend. Everybody talks about it but nobody ever witnessed an actual implementation. [Paypal](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/paypal-rest-payment-hateoas-links/) proposes one:

```json
[{
	"href": "https://api.sandbox.paypal.com/v1/payments/payment/PAY-6RV70583SB702805EKEYSZ6Y",
	"rel": "self",
	"method": "GET"
}, {
	"href": "https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/webscr?cmd=_express-checkout&amp;token=EC-60U79048BN77196",
	"rel": "approval_url",
	"method": "REDIRECT"
}, {
	"href": "https://api.sandbox.paypal.com/v1/payments/payment/PAY-6RV70583SB702805EKEYSZ6Y/execute",
	"rel": "execute",
	"method": "POST"
}]
```
In our Amazon case, a call to /customers/007 would then return the details of the customer, along with pointers towards linked resources :

```
GET /customers/007
200 Ok
{
	"id": "007",
	"firstname": "James",
	...,
	"links": [{
			"rel": "self",
			"href": "https://api.domain.com/v1/customers/007",
			"method": "GET"
		}, {
			"rel": "addresses",
			"href": "https://api.domain.com/v1/addresses/42",
			"method": "GET"
		}, {
			"rel": "orders",
			"href": "https://api.domain.com/v1/orders/1234",
			"method": "GET"
		},
		...
	]
}
```
For implementing HATEOAS, we recommend using the following method, also applied in the pagination section, compliant with [RFC 5988](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#page-6) and usable by clients that don’t support several Header “Link”:

```
GET /customers/007
200 Ok
{ 
  	"id":"007", 
	"firstname":"James",
	...
}
Link : https://api.domain.com/v1/customers/007; rel="self"; method:"GET",
https://api.domain.com/v1/addresses/42; rel="addresses"; method:"GET",
https://api.domain.com/v1/orders/1234; rel="orders"; method:"GET"
```
---

## 9. API Versioning
---

As a rule of thumb, **never release a non-versioned API** to production.

### Semantic Versioning
As a specification of our APIs we use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). This is an specification authored by Tom Preston-Werner based on three digits *MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH*

Theses are the main rules about this specification

* A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0.

* Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version MUST NOT be modified. Any modifications MUST be released as a new version.

* Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.

* Version 1.0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the version number is incremented after this release is dependent on this public API and how it changes.

* Patch version Z (x.y.**Z** | Z > 0) MUST be incremented if only backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.

* Minor version Y (x.**Y**.z | Y > 0) MUST be incremented if new, backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public API. It MUST be incremented if any public API functionality is marked as deprecated. It MAY be incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced within the private code. It MAY include patch level changes. Patch version MUST be reset to 0 when minor version is incremented.

* Major version X (**X**.y.z | X > 0) MUST be incremented if any backwards incompatible changes are introduced to the public API. It MAY include minor and patch level changes. Patch and minor version MUST be reset to 0 when major version is incremented.


## 10. API throughput restrictions
---
For performance reasons and to ensure homogeneous response times in our APIs, it is good practice to limit the API's consumption. This limitation can be performed based on many factors:

* **Limit requests in a time slot for an authenticated user**. Such limitations are usually carried out in public APIs to control abusive access to the APIs. There are several approaches such as restricting the number of day / month requests for authenticated users.
* **Limit requests for public / private consumption API depending on the authenticated user profile**. Usually public APIs have limited consumption, always with the concept of ensuring homogeneous consumption of all users allowing resizing infrastructure in stages. We have to pay special care to paying consumers in non-free APIs and respect consumer's quotas.

To manage request' rates, some headers could be used:

* **X-Rate-Limit-Limit**: Allowed request number for current period of time (window)
* **X-Rate-Limit-Remaining**: Remaining request number for current period of time (window)
* **X-Rate-Limit-Reset**: The number of seconds left in the current period time (window). It is necessary to clarify at this point that should not be confused with a timestamp, you should use seconds remaining to avoid problems with time zones.

As we can see in the following [link](#examples-api-throughput-restrictions), There are multiple APIs that use these headers to provide information about throughput and limits.

Finally, , when request limit is reached, response will return this code status: ***HTTP - 429 Too Many Requests*** as indicated in the [RFC 6585 Section 4](#rfc-6585-section-4)


## 11. OAuth
---

### Introduction

The Open Authentication (OAuth) authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

This is a very brief introduction, please refer to [OAuth RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for a detailed documentation.

### Roles

It is very important to know the involved roles for the sake of this section's understanding:

OAuth defines four roles:

   * resource owner : An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource. When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an end-user.
   * resource server : The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.
   * client : An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization.  The term "client" does not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g., whether the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other devices).
   * authorization server : The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization. The authorization server may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity. A single authorization server may issue access tokens accepted by multiple resource servers.

### OAuth Authentication Flow

The image below describes the authentication flow (usually referred as OAuth handshake or negotiation).

![OAuth Authentication Flow](static/oauth_flow.png "OAuth Protocol Flow")

We can observe 3 separated blocks in this negotiation:

1. **Authorization request to access protected resources from a resource owner**, there are several granting types to use, see references for further details

> We recommend to delegate this authorization process to an authorization server, but it could be handled directly by the resource owner

2. **Access token request**, using the authorization grant obtained in the previous step the client obtains a valid OAuth access token
3. **Retrieval of protected resources**, using OAuth access token obtained in previous step

This scenario can be referred as **3-legged OAuth**. There is a special case when resource owner and client is the same entity, this is called **2-legged OAuth** because there is no need of authorization request from resource owner.

### Scopes

Access tokens are associated to a set of scopes that represent permissions on how and which resources are available for a given token. We recommend to carefully define a rich set of scopes that enable a fine grained set of permissions to restrict client's access and operations to protected resources.

### Token expiration and refresh

Access tokens should have a defined expiration time. It is not a good practice to allow a token to last forever. If a client need to extend the expiration time, a "refresh token" endpoint should be available. In this case, in step 2 of protocol flow a refresh token is provided along with the access token. This refresh token should be used by the client for refreshing the expiration time of a token. See RFC for further details.

### Caching access tokens

A good practice to avoid an unnecessary traffic overhead to the authorization server is to enable caching in clients. This access token will not change until expires.

### Use of TLS/SSL

Client credentials should never travel as plain text without using SSL on requests. This way credentials are protected from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

However, even with the use of TLS/SSL credentials could be sent to the wrong server using OAuth 2.0 - either by misconfiguration or because the server has been compromised. If this is critical for us, maybe the credentials should not travel as plain text, but signed. This sacrifices complexity over protocol requests for a higher security.

### Examples

Below is a list of sample implementations of OAuth 2.0:

* [Google APIs](#google-apis)
* [Twitter APIs](#twitter-apis)

## 12. Errors
---

A major element of web services is planning for when things go wrong, and propagating error messages back to consumer applications. However, REST-based web services do not have a well-defined convention for returning error messages. 

Nonetheless, here are the most important criteria for managing REST API response errors:

1. Error Messages must be readable for humans: Part of the major appeal of REST based web services is that you can open any browser, type in the right URL, and see an immediate response -- no special tools needed. However, HTTP error codes do not always provide enough information and we need to include a short description of the error occurred. 

2. Application Specific Errors: The response's body in errors must have the imprint of the application. 

3. Error Codes must be readable for other applications: As a third criteria, error codes should be easily readable by other applications.

So the best option for response error are:

1. Use HTTP Status Codes for problems specifically related to HTTP, and not specifically related to your web service.

2. When an error occurs, always return an error code and description document detailing this. 

3. Error document must contain both an error code, and a human readable error message.

#### 400: Bad Request

User error. A required field or parameter has not been provided, the value supplied is invalid, or the combination of provided fields is invalid.

This error can be thrown when trying to add a duplicate resource. For example:

```json
Response's status code : 400

Response's payload
{
 	"errors": [
		{
		    "code": "0x00000",
		    "message": "Bad Request"
		}
	]
}
```

#### 401: Invalid Credentials

Invalid authorization header. The access token you're using is either expired or invalid.

```json
Response's status code : 401

Response's payload
{
 	"errors": [
		{
		    "code": "0x00001",
		    "message": "Invalid credentials"
		}
	]
}
```

#### 403: Forbidden

You are identified, but you do not have the necessary authorizations.

```json
Response's status code : 403

Response's payload
{
 	"errors": [
		{
		    "code": "0x00002",
		    "message": "You are not allowed to access the specified resource"
		}
	]
}
```

## 13. Status and Health endpoints
---

A good practice for you REST API is to reserve a couple of endpoints for checking the status and health/integrity of the API.

### Status endpoint

The status endpoint allows third party applications to check if your API is UP or DOWN.

A good endpoint could be **/status**.

The convention for this endpoint is to return a 200 status code response with a very simple response. For example:

```json
{
    "status":"UP"
}
```

Any other response status should be interpreted as an outline API.

### Health endpoint

The health endpoint goes a step further and it does not only informs about the availability of the API but also about its integrity and health.

A good endpoint could be **/health**.

The response in case that our API is healthy could be very similar to the one returned by the status endpoint, a 200 response with the following body:

```json
{
    "health" : "OK"
}
```

We should check the status of every needed sub-component for our API to work correctly. For example, we could check the status of any databases or external services.

In case we need a more verbose response, we could enable a second endpoint whose response could be more detailed. For example, **/health/systems** could return a 200 response with the following body:

```json
{
    "health" : {
        "subsystem A" : "OK",
        "subsystem B" : "KO",
        "subsystem C" : "OK",
        "subsystem D" : "OK"
    }
}
```

This endpoint **should not be published to third party applications** because this information is typically needed for internal development or architecture issues.
